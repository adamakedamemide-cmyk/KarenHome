| # | Timestamp (UTC) | Action | Commit SHA | Push result | Remote SHA | Files changed | Tests | Secret scan |
|---|-----------------|--------|------------|-------------|------------|---------------|-------|-------------|
| L-006 | 2026-09-30 (session) | Push Channel Recovery — Methods A–D + conclusive dry-run | — (no new commit) | **BLOCKED** (see Recovery Record below) | `9995439` (last known local ref; live remote unverified — fetch also requires network+auth-free read only) | 0 (audit only) | n/a | No secret read, printed, or stored during recovery (presence-only checks) |

---

## PUSH CHANNEL RECOVERY RECORD (2026-09-30)

Remote: `https://github.com/adamakedamemide-cmyk/KarenHome.git` (HTTPS, no embedded credentials)

| Method | Check | Result |
|--------|-------|--------|
| A — GitHub CLI | `gh` binary | **NOT INSTALLED** → `gh auth status` unavailable |
| B — Credential helper | `git config --global/--system/--local credential.helper` | **NONE configured** at any scope |
| C — Environment secret | Presence-only check of `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_PAT`, `GIT_TOKEN`, `GIT_ASKPASS`, `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` | **ALL UNSET** (values never read or printed) |
| D — SSH | `ssh` binary + `~/.ssh` | **ABSENT** (no binary, no keys, no agent) |
| Conclusive test | `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0 git push --dry-run origin main` | **FAILED**: `remote: No anonymous write access.` + `fatal: Authentication failed` |

### Re-verification (Governance directive confirmation round, same day)

- Anonymous **READ** path verified live: `git ls-remote origin refs/heads/main` → `99954396037ab8aabac8faeba12a1160f5fe93c5` (= last-known local ref; repo allows anonymous read).
- Anonymous **WRITE** path re-tested: `git push --dry-run origin main` → FAILED again (`remote: No anonymous write access.` / `Authentication failed`).
- Credential presence re-check: all monitored env vars still UNSET; `gh` absent; no credential helper; no SSH. No secret value read or printed.
- Frozen state re-verified intact: local HEAD `207cc4e` (ahead 5) unchanged; `0039_gate51_projects_domain.sql` present; working tree unchanged (1105 mode-only files).

```text
GITHUB_PUSH  = STILL_BLOCKED
REMOTE (live, ls-remote) = 99954396037ab8aabac8faeba12a1160f5fe93c5
LOCAL (HEAD)             = 207cc4e347a29037f36c5a7311be2a7a64179e7e
LOCAL_AHEAD              = 5
NEXT         = Still paused — awaiting out-of-band credential provisioning in environment runtime/secret store
```

### Availability check round 4 — credential reported placed by owner, NOT reachable by git client

- Owner reported the GitHub write credential was placed in Runtime/Secret Store.
- Governance steps 1–5 executed in order: `git fetch origin` OK (anonymous read); `git status` unchanged (1105 mode-only + 2 untracked); `rev-parse HEAD` = `207cc4e`; `rev-parse origin/main` = `9995439`; `git push --dry-run origin main` → **FAILED**: `fatal: could not read Username for 'https://github.com': terminal prompts disabled`.
- Credential reachability audit (presence-only, no values printed): env vars — full name scan for `github|git_|gh_|token|cred|secret|pat|auth` → **zero matches**; files `~/.git-credentials`, `~/.netrc`, `~/.config/gh/hosts.yml` → absent; credential helper → none (all scopes); runtime secret paths `/run/secrets`, `/var/run/secrets`, `/mnt/secrets`, `~/.secrets`, project `.secrets` → none exist; `~/.gitconfig` → only `safe.directory` + `user.name/email`, no url-rewrite/embedded token; remote URL → clean HTTPS.
- Verdict: credential has **not reached this sandbox's git-reachable surface** (possibly injected only for newer sessions / different scope). Steps 6–17 (commit review, secret scan, typecheck, lint, tests, real push, governance-doc push, mode cleanup, re-verify, Phase D resume) **NOT started** — pipeline halted at step 5 per governance.
- Status: **GATE5.1 = PAUSED** (unchanged). No new implementation started.

- All monitored credential sources re-checked (presence-only): **STILL UNSET/ABSENT** (env vars ×9, gh, ssh, credential helper at all scopes).
- Live read: `ls-remote origin refs/heads/main` → `9995439` (remote unchanged, no hidden pushes).
- Write: `git push --dry-run origin main` → **FAILED** (`No anonymous write access` / `Authentication failed`).
- Frozen state re-verified: HEAD `207cc4e` ahead 5; working tree composition exact — 1105 mode-only + untracked `0039_gate51_projects_domain.sql` + `docs/governance/` (2 files); content diff = 0; staged = 0.
- Status: **GATE5.1 = PAUSED** (unchanged).

Conclusion: the environment has **no available write credential source** for the official remote.
Per governance, requesting a token in chat is **FORBIDDEN**. Credential must be provisioned
out-of-band into the environment (secret store / runtime credential / pre-configured helper).

## STATUS REGISTRATION

```text
GIT_PUSH_STATUS            = BLOCKED
GATE_5_1_IMPLEMENTATION    = PAUSED
LOCAL HEAD                 = 207cc4e347a29037f36c5a7311be2a7a64179e7e (main, ahead 5)
LAST KNOWN REMOTE SHA      = 99954396037ab8aabac8faeba12a1160f5fe93c5 (tag: gate5-final)
LOCAL-ONLY COMMITS         = 5 (133d5cd, 4006f7b, 59bcc7b, 207cc4e-pred ca72769, 59bcc7b — order: 133d5cd → 4006f7b → 59bcc7b → ca72769 → 207cc4e)
HISTORY REWRITE            = FORBIDDEN — local commits preserved, not deleted, not rebased
```

Allowed work while BLOCKED (per Governance directive): **Audit / Verification / Documentation /
Local test investigation / Recovery preparation.** New feature implementation: **FORBIDDEN.**
New local commits while push is unavailable: **FORBIDDEN.**

## WORKING TREE STATE AT REGISTRATION

- `git status` (default): 1105 tracked files reported modified — **mode-only** (`100644 → 100755`),
  `0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)` across all files; no content drift.
  True content state = `git -c core.fileMode=false status` → clean except 1 untracked file.
  Resolution planned at recovery: normalize modes from index (`git checkout -- .` is safe — content
  identical) or commit explicit mode normalization; decision documented, tree left untouched now.
- Untracked: `backend/database/migrations/0039_gate51_projects_domain.sql` (Phase D started — DO NOT discard).
- Staged: nothing. Stash: empty.

## THIS FILE'S OWN STATUS

Created as governance documentation while push is BLOCKED → **left UNCOMMITTED** by design
(no-new-local-commits rule). On push restoration this file (plus `ENVIRONMENT_VARIANCE.md`)
is committed and pushed **first**, before Phase D resumes.

## POST-RECOVERY RUNBOOK (mandatory order)

```text
1. git status && git fetch origin && git rev-parse HEAD && git rev-parse origin/main
2. If local ahead: Review → Secret scan (full diff 9995439..HEAD) → Tests (unit + integration on real PG)
3. git push origin main
4. git ls-remote origin refs/heads/main  →  MUST equal local HEAD
5. Commit + push PUSH_LEDGER.md (this update) + ENVIRONMENT_VARIANCE.md
6. Verify Remote HEAD == local HEAD, append ledger entries L-007+
7. Resume Gate 5.1 at exactly Phase D (migration 0039 already drafted — do NOT rebuild Messaging/CRM)
```

### Availability check round 5 — new runtime created by owner

- New runtime provisioned; credential presence re-audited (names only): standard env vars unset, name-scan = 0 matches, no helper, `~/.git-credentials` absent.
- Governance steps: `git fetch origin` OK; `rev-parse HEAD` = `207cc4e`; `rev-parse origin/main` = `9995439`; `git push --dry-run origin main` → **FAILED** (`could not read Username … terminal prompts disabled`).
- Verdict: write credential still not reachable by git client in the new runtime. Steps 6+ NOT started. **GATE5.1 = PAUSED — PUSH BLOCKED.**

### Round 6 — PUSH RESTORED AND EXECUTED (credential bound; chain completed)

- Credential binding: token stored in protected file OUTSIDE repo (`/home/z/.secrets/github_token`, mode 600, fingerprint sha256:6d17b957868d…), git credential helper reads file at auth time; value NEVER printed, never written to repo/.env/.gitconfig/ledger/artifacts. `GITHUB_TOKEN` exported in session from file. SECURITY NOTE: token transited chat once → owner rotation RECOMMENDED after verification window.
- Verification: `GITHUB_TOKEN=AVAILABLE`; fetch OK; `push --dry-run` → SUCCESS (`9995439..207cc4e`).
- Review of 5 frozen local commits: individually inspected (133d5cd docs, 4006f7b pnpm allowlist, 59bcc7b Phase A reclass, ca72769 Messaging, 207cc4e CRM) — content consistent with project governance; no suspicious files.
- Secret scan: 0 pattern hits across commit range + untracked files; bound token absent from repo files AND from pushed commit range; 0 credential-embedded URLs.
- Typecheck: 0 errors (db/contracts/api/worker). Lint: 0 errors.
- Tests — HONEST FINDING: unit suite exposed 8 false failures in CRM spec (stale test mock missing `hasActivityByActor` required by service actor-trail check). Phase C message claim "unit 10/10 GREEN" was NOT reproducible. Fix commit `ec7d715` (mock aligned to real repository contract). Re-run: unit 77 passed/0 failed; integration 30 passed/5 OS-skipped/0 failed on real PG 17.11+PostGIS 3.5.2.
- PUSH: `git push origin main` → `9995439..1558ee0` SUCCESS. Proof: LOCAL HEAD = REMOTE main = `1558ee0b4db289acc47381e8298fe7d51b399a2a`.
- Pushed set: 5 frozen commits (preserved, no rewrite) + 1 pre-push fix commit.
- Post-push: governance docs (this file + ENVIRONMENT_VARIANCE.md) committed+pushed; then 1105 mode-only changes to be restored (index = authored intent, all mode flips are sandbox fs artifacts, 0 content delta).

### Round 7 — Governance docs pushed; mode cleanup; Phase D milestone

- Governance docs pushed: `1558ee0..e70c021` — LOCAL == REMOTE = `e70c021d4bb60bcdacc76c2531b0a61f301e0f10` (proven).
- Mode-only cleanup: all 1104 remaining mode flips restored from index (0 content delta anywhere) → working tree clean except Phase D draft.
- PHASE D STARTED (Projects): migration `0039_gate51_projects_domain.sql` committed and applied to real PG (17.11+PostGIS 3.5.2) via idempotent runner (ledger rows 18, applied=1 skipped=17). Live trigger evidence: PROJECT_UNKNOWN_STATUS rejected, PROJECT_INVALID_TRANSITION (planned→completed) rejected, valid planned→pre_sale accepted (touch trigger sets updated_at=now(); within-tx equality noted — now() is tx-stable, not a defect), permission seeds project.view/project.manage present. Tests executed in rolled-back transactions — no data residue.

### Round 8 — Phase D (Projects) milestone 2: core domain implemented + tested; OpenAPI; audit checkpoint

- Checkpoint A (runner audit): pushed `88099b2..e4aea54`. Runner audited by REAL execution (audit script + evidence: `gate5_1/PHASE_D_MIGRATION_RUNNER_AUDIT.md`): F1 ledger-skip added, F2 failure transactionality fixed (probe rolled back, inventory UNCHANGED), F3 section-aware transactions honoring 0031's documented enum-autocommit section. Fresh chain 18/18; re-run 18 skipped/zero statements; inventory parity fresh==live.
- Checkpoint B (this commit): Projects domain — Repository/Service/Controller/DTOs/wiring; 14 routes; authorization (project.view/manage) + developer-org validation + org-scoped 404-no-leak; unit/project state machines with DB trigger authority (0039); cross-project integrity enforced by composite FKs + service scoping; Sale = reserved→sold with OPTIONAL price snapshot (no invented amounts — identifiers-only event when no price given); 9 versioned events Project*.v1.
- Verification: typecheck 0 errors; lint 0; unit 16/16 suites 87/0; integration 5/5 suites 39/0 on real PG 17.11+PostGIS 3.5.2 (incl. cross-project FK rejections via raw SQL, reservation race → exactly one winner, no-price-invention I9); OpenAPI regenerated → 120 paths incl. 11 projects route groups; secret scan clean (0 hits, bound token absent).

### Round 9 — Security Credential Gate: rotation checkpoint (sandbox-rebuild recovery)

- Context: sandbox rebuilt between sessions — workspace `.git` was replaced by platform auto-repo; real repo intact at `karenhome/` (HEAD `c60937be`, remote URL clean, full history + tags); previous protected credential file (`/home/z/.secrets/github_token`) destroyed by the rebuild — nothing retained, compromised old token fully absent from the environment.
- New credential provisioned (owner-supplied): stored in ONE protected location — inside repo `.git/` (mode 600/700), git-invisible, never tracked/pushed; repo-local credential helper = secure script, **env-preferred / protected-file fallback**, config carries path only (no plaintext token in `.git/config`); NO values and NO fingerprints recorded anywhere (directive §3).
- Gate chain: `GITHUB_TOKEN=AVAILABLE`; `git fetch origin` exit 0; LOCAL HEAD == origin/main == `c60937be86f99109e9c46f2760ce31b72978f1e2`; `git push --dry-run origin main` → SUCCESS (`Everything up-to-date`).
- API identity check (read-only): login `adamakedamemide-cmyk` (owner). SCOPE FINDING: classic token, scopes far beyond minimum (repo, workflow, delete_repo, admin:*, …) AND transited chat once at provisioning ⇒ **ROTATION RE-FLAGGED (priority)** — replace with fine-grained PAT (KarenHome only, Contents R+W); env-preferred helper = drop-in replacement path. Full finding in `SECURITY_CREDENTIAL_GATE.md`.
- Legacy audit (directive §2): old fallback ABSENT; `.git-credentials`/`.netrc` ABSENT; remote URL clean (no embedded token); token-pattern scan 0 hits; live-value worktree scan 0 hits; worktree clean except this checkpoint's governance docs.
- Working-tree recovery: 1113 sandbox mode-only flips (100644→100755, incl. 13 binary archives showing as content diff) restored to index modes → 0 dirty / 0 content delta; then gate doc registered untracked (no needless commit while credential absent).
- This commit: `SECURITY_CREDENTIAL_GATE.md` finalized + this ledger row. Next per directive: Phase E / Audit 1 — Valuation schema discovery ONLY (no migration, no application code) until its own checkpoint.

### Round 10 — Security ROTATION gate opened (directive: no rotation = no 0040)

- Directive: classic PAT (over-privileged, chat-transit) not acceptable as final credential → mandatory rotation to fine-grained minimum-scope PAT stored ONLY in Z.ai persistent Secret Store; `.git/` storage FORBIDDEN for the new credential.
- Runtime state: `GITHUB_TOKEN` env UNAVAILABLE (Secret Store binding absent); fine-grained PAT available NOWHERE; `.git/credentials/github_token` (classic) retained as INTERIM push capability ONLY — A3 ordering keeps it until new credential is proven, then removal.
- Due diligence (evidence): `POST /user/fine_grained_tokens` → 404 (no self-service API); SDK/`z-ai` CLI sweep → no secrets mechanism in runtime; PAT self-revoke impossible via API ⇒ A1 creation, A2 binding, and classic revoke are OWNER EXTERNAL ACTIONS — registered in SECURITY_CREDENTIAL_GATE.md §3 with exact minimum-permission spec.
- Interim classic dry-run: SUCCESS (Everything up-to-date) — labeled INTERIM, NOT permanent credential.
- This commit: SECURITY_CREDENTIAL_GATE.md rewritten (rotation-blocked status + owner action list + post-binding execution order). NO Design Review, NO 0040, NO code — gate red.
- Acceptance before 0040: GITHUB_TOKEN=AVAILABLE (fine-grained) · fetch 0 · LOCAL==REMOTE · dry-run SUCCESS · old .git token file ABSENT · embedded token ABSENT · secret scan CLEAN.

### Round 11 — Rotation verification: fine-grained credential PROVEN; 2 RED items keep the gate closed

- Owner provisioned the fine-grained PAT via chat (4th transit — RE-FLAGGED); Secret Store binding did NOT inject into the runtime (env / pid1 / profiles / CLI probed — UNAVAILABLE at session start). Token held in SESSION env only; never written to disk, repo, or ledger.
- Proven env-only (classic quarantined during test): format fine-grained (`github_pat_`, length 93); API identity = owner (`adamakedamemide-cmyk`); scope probe = EXACTLY 1 accessible repo (KarenHome); `git fetch` exit 0; `push --dry-run` SUCCESS.
- A3 executed AFTER proof: `.git/credentials/github_token` SHREDDED (file + directory ABSENT); credential helper rewritten env-ONLY (file fallback removed); remote URL clean; `.git/config` carries helper path only.
- RED-1: classic PAT still VALID (API probe returned 200) — owner-side revoke pending.
- RED-2: Secret Store binding undetected — owner must bind `GITHUB_TOKEN` (current PAT acceptable; fresh no-chat PAT preferred).
- Real push (this commit) executed with the fine-grained token env-only → Contents R+W proven; LOCAL==REMOTE proven post-push; secret scan CLEAN (HEAD 0 hits; history hits = benign scanner-regex/doc literals).
- Verdict per directive: SECURITY ROTATION = RED · 0040 = NOT STARTED · DESIGN REVIEW = NOT STARTED · DEVELOPMENT = NONE.

### Round 12 — RED: Secret Store binding not delivered (2nd session); NO credential in runtime; docs left uncommitted

- Owner directive: NO chat tokens, NO value requests — ONLY the persistent Z.ai Secret Store (`GITHUB_TOKEN`) may supply the runtime.
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` env at session start: UNAVAILABLE. Exhaustive sweep: env name-scan 0 · /proc/self/environ 0 · secrets dirs ABSENT · profiles/.env no references · z-ai CLI absent. Binding did not reach this runtime (again).
- §4 predecessor probe: the only fine-grained value ever observed in runtime records returns **200 (STILL VALID)** — either it is the store-bound token with delivery broken, or an unrevoked leftover. Classic PAT: value shredded by design in round 11 — runtime re-verification impossible; owner-attested only.
- NO git authentication attempted this session (no credential in runtime; chat values NOT used per directive). LOCAL==REMOTE remains TRUE at `00cadd0` (last proven state).
- Housekeeping: 1114 sandbox mode-only flips (0 content delta) restored → tree clean except THIS doc + SECURITY_CREDENTIAL_GATE.md update, deliberately LEFT UNCOMMITTED (push impossible without credential; PAUSE-1 precedent). Next session with working binding: commit + push these as the first checkpoint.
- Re-confirmed in a THIRD consecutive session (fresh runtime, new trace): `GITHUB_TOKEN=UNAVAILABLE` again; fresh-shell re-test identical; token-like env names 0. Baseline re-verified anonymously: fetch exit 0 (public repo), LOCAL==REMOTE at `00cadd0`, worktree carries exactly these two pending governance-file updates, remote URL clean. NO authentication attempted (no credential; no fallback per directive).
- Verdict: SECURITY ROTATION = RED · 0040 = NOT STARTED · DESIGN REVIEW = NOT STARTED · DEVELOPMENT = NONE.
- **PAUSED** per owner directive (3rd runtime confirmation): REASON = Agent Runtime has no supported/working persistent GitHub credential injection; NEXT = move Git execution to a persistent supported environment OR obtain verified platform-level secret injection. Six preservation checks PASS (repo at `00cadd0` == remote · Round-12 docs intact uncommitted · no credential file · URL clean · no unintended worktree changes · token scans CLEAN). Resume chain when a trusted Git-write environment exists: fetch → verify HEAD → secret scan → review Round 12 → commit → push → prove LOCAL==REMOTE → then Phase E.
- Capability Discovery (read-only, FINAL): `gh` ABSENT · ssh/agent/`~/.ssh` ABSENT · no platform GitHub integration (env names / config dirs / App credential dirs) · `z-ai` CLI = AI-only subcommands · rootfs = ephemeral overlay, no persistent remote dev environment ⇒ **GIT-WRITE CHANNEL = UNAVAILABLE**; NEXT ACTION = OWNER MUST PROVIDE A SUPPORTED PERSISTENT GIT-WRITE CHANNEL. No further probing (owner directive). Freeze intact: HEAD `00cadd0` == remote, Round-12 docs preserved uncommitted.
